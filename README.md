Metrics Sample
==============

This project contains a simple Servlet application that has been customised to emit metrics from the [WebSphere Liberty](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/websphere-liberty/) server and the app using the [Dropwizard Metrics API](http://www.dropwizard.io/. The sample also demonstrates (using Docker containers) how to monitor your Liberty metrics using [collectd](https://collectd.org/), [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/), and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

## Running the Liberty app in Eclipse

1. Download and install [Eclipse with the WebSphere Developer Tools](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-eclipse/).
2. Create a new Liberty Profile Server. See [step 3](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-eclipse/) for details.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Import the sample into Eclipse using *File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects* option.
5. Right click on the project and go to *Properties > Project Facets* and select *Dynamic Web Module* (if not already selected).
6. Deploy the sample into Liberty server. Right click on the *servlet* sample and select *Run As -> Run on Server* option. Find and select the Liberty profile server and press *Finish*. 
7. Go to: [http://localhost:9080/servlet](http://localhost:9080/servlet)

## Running with Maven

This project can be built with Apache Maven. The project uses Liberty Maven Plug-in to automatically download and install Liberty with Java EE7 Web Profile runtime from Maven Central. Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. Execute full Maven build. This will cause Liberty Maven Plug-in to download and install Liberty server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

2. To run the server with the sample:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```

Once the server is running, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/MetricsExample](http://localhost:9080/MetricsExample).
