Metrics Sample
==============

This project contains a simple Servlet application that has been customised to emit metrics from the [WebSphere Liberty](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/websphere-liberty/) server and the app using the [Dropwizard Metrics API](http://www.dropwizard.io/). The sample also demonstrates (using Docker containers) how to monitor your Liberty metrics using [collectd](https://collectd.org/), [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/), and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

The instructions below are minimal so that you can just get the sample running. For more detail and for instructions on how to add metrics to a servlet application, check out [this article on WASdev.net](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/docs/collect-metrics-from-liberty-apps-and-display-in-grafana/).

## Running with Maven

To run the entire demonstration:

1. Make sure you have installed Java 8, Docker, and Maven.
2. Clone this repository to your local harddrive:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WASdev/sample.metrics.git
    ```
3. Change to the `sample.metrics` directory:
    ```bash
    cd sample.metrics
    ```
4. Build the sample:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
5. Build the Liberty Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t example:liberty .
    ```
6. Run the Liberty Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker run --name liberty -d -p 9080:9080 -p 9443:9443 example:liberty
    ```
7. Check that the application is running in a browser at http://localhost:9080/MetricsExample
8. Change to the `collectd` directory:
    ```bash
    cd collectd
    ```
9. Change the permissions on the bash script in the directory then run the script:
    ```bash
    chmod 755 collectd_graphite_setup.sh
    ./collectd_graphite_setup.sh
    ```
    (This copies some files collectd needs from the running Liberty container, builds a collectd Docker image, runs a Graphite Docker container from DockerHub, and runs the collectd Docker container.
10. Check that the Graphite application is running and displaying metrics in a browser at http://localhost:80
11. If you want to display the metrics in Grafana:
    ```bash
    docker run -i --name grafana -d -p 3000:3000 --link graphite grafana/grafana
    ```
12. Open Grafana in a browser: http://localhost:3000
13. Add the Graphite server as a data source in Grafana and then import the provided dashboard from `sample.metrics/grafana/MetricsSampleDashboard.json`.
